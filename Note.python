To install pygom from these local files:
- in the repo root, run "python setup.py sdist"
  [this creates a dist directory with a tar file in it called e.g. pygom-0.1.7.dev1+gbbd58f3.tar.gz]
- then run "pip install" on the tarfile, e.g.:
  pip install pygom-0.1.7.dev1+gbbd58f3.tar.gz

This should uninstall whatever current pygom, and install the new one.
